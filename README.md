## Micro-geographic co-location patterns of firms and industries in Hungary: effects on firm success, failure, and acquisition

**Supervisor:** Sándor Juhász

**Short description:**
This thesis (1) identifies micro-geographic co-location patterns of companies in Hungary—such as firms located on the same street or in the same building—and (2) examines how these patterns influence firm success, failure, and acquisition. Using detailed firm-level data, the study explores whether proximity to other businesses affects firm performance through mechanisms like knowledge spillovers, competition, or network effects. The analysis applies spatial and econometric methods to quantify these relationships.

**Research questions/Tasks/Topics:** <br>
* What are the micro-geographic co-location patterns of firms and industries in Hungary?<br>
* Do supply chain and labor market connections explain micro-geographic co-location of firms?<br>
* How does close proximity (same street or building) influence firm success, failure, and acquisition?<br>
